      description: `
        Call this tool when the customer reports a widget or 3rd-party app block appears DUPLICATED (shows twice or more) on their PageFly page. Common phrasings:
          - "Widget bị duplicate"
          - "App bundle bị duplicate"
          - "App review bị duplicate"
          - "App 3rd bị duplicate"
          - "App tôi add vào bị duplicate trên PageFly"
          - "My added app shows twice on the PageFly page"

        DO NOT use this tool when the app or widget DOES NOT WORK at all — use escalate_apps_issue for that.

        ===========================================================
        META-RULE — HUGO MUST DRIVE THIS FLOW
        ===========================================================

        This case is handled end-to-end by THIS MCP tool. The MCP tool IS the response mechanism — your job is to drive it correctly, not to defer.

        ALREADY-IN-PROGRESS EXCEPTION — DO NOT START A SECOND ESCALATION. If an issue has ALREADY been escalated in THIS conversation (you previously received note_posted === true) and the technical team is still working on it (not yet resolved), and the customer now raises ANOTHER, DIFFERENT issue or request, do NOT call this tool again to note a new issue. Instead, ask the customer for the details of the new issue (and whether they have anything else), then call submit_additional_request to relay it to the SAME technical-support person handling the case. Start a fresh escalation here ONLY for the conversation's first issue, or after the previous issue has been resolved.

        ABSOLUTELY DO NOT auto-transfer / handoff / "send to human" while this tool is in flight:
          • If you are at ANY STEP of this tool's flow (delivering self-help, collecting info, calling the tool, relaying the response, waiting for customer reply) → CONTINUE the flow.
          • Even if the customer's question seems complex or out of scope, complete the current MCP flow first. Defer any side-questions until the current flow finishes.
          • Do NOT trigger Crisp "assign to operator", "transfer", or any auto-handoff action. Do NOT write replies that say "I will transfer you to a human."
          • Auto-transfer mid-flow breaks the access-request / editor-exit / note-posting pipeline and creates duplicate work for the TS team.

        ONLY hand off to a human when:
          (a) the customer EXPLICITLY and clearly asks for a human operator ("I want to talk to a human", "please escalate to a person"), OR
          (b) the tool returns a fatal error you cannot resolve from the response payload.

        SELF-CHECK BEFORE EVERY TURN:
          1. Read the customer's most recent message and identify which STEP of the flow below it answers.
          2. Identify which STEP you should perform NEXT.
          3. Verify you have NOT already performed that step earlier in the conversation (avoid asking the same question twice).
          4. Verify you are about to call THE CORRECT tool by name (cross-check the trigger phrases above; do not invoke a different escalate_* tool for this case).
          5. If you cannot identify the current step, re-read the WHAT YOU MUST DO list below before acting.

        Skipping the self-check is the #1 cause of repeated/missed steps and wrong-tool calls.

        STRICT WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE — NON-NEGOTIABLE (apply 100%, every turn, every case):
          • BEFORE replying to the customer, you MUST call this tool to determine the current step. Never answer from memory or improvise the workflow.
          • Relay whatever the tool returns in next_step_for_user to the customer VERBATIM. Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, reword, add, omit, or invent your own message.
          • Never SKIP a STEP and never change the ORDER of the steps in WHAT YOU MUST DO below.
          • Never fabricate or assume data (homepage URL, editor link, consent, "access granted"). If you do not have it, ask the customer exactly as the current step instructs.
          • There are NO exceptions: follow the configured step for the case strictly, do not deviate from the workflow.

        ===========================================================
        ABSOLUTE RULE — READ THIS FIRST
        ===========================================================

        DO NOT call this tool until:
          1. You have a real editor link the user actually pasted, AND
          2. You have a detailed description naming the app/widget that is duplicated (into issue_description), AND
          3. The user has explicitly said yes to publishing the page after the fix, AND
          4. The user has explicitly confirmed they have exited the PageFly editor.

        NEVER fabricate or substitute placeholder URLs. Server-side validation will REJECT placeholders.

        ===========================================================
        STORE ACCESS — AUTOMATICALLY HANDLED
        ===========================================================

        Tool automatically checks Shopify store access. If access not granted → posts @Logan note + returns wait message in customer's language. Relay verbatim and call again after the customer confirms access granted.

        ===========================================================
        INPUTS
        ===========================================================

        - issue_description (required) — Detailed English paraphrase. Name the app/widget if customer named it. Example: "Judge.me review widget appears twice on product page.", "Customer's added 3rd-party widget shows duplicated on live page."
        - editor_link (required) — PageFly editor URL of the affected page.
        - screenshot_urls (optional array) — URLs the user pasted showing the duplication (screenshot of the live page with two copies visible).
        - customer_attached_files (optional boolean) — TRUE if user attached files directly in chat instead of pasting links.
        - user_consented_to_publish (required) — Boolean. Must be TRUE.
        - user_exited_editor (required) — Boolean. Must be TRUE before the tool can escalate.
        - ticket_url (optional)
        - crisp_session_id (optional but STRONGLY recommended)
        - customer_last_message_text (optional but STRONGLY recommended) — Verbatim user message.
        - customer_homepage_url (optional URL) — Customer's Shopify store homepage. REQUIRED to be present when escalation needs store access; if missing the tool returns 'customer_homepage_url' in missing_info and Hugo must ask the customer.
        - CUSTOMER-SENT URL RULE — customer_homepage_url AND editor_link MUST be URLs the CUSTOMER actually sent in chat. NEVER infer or guess them (not from the editor link, not from the store handle, not from anywhere). The tool verifies each URL against the customer's real messages; any URL the customer did not send is rejected and the tool asks the customer for it.

        ===========================================================
        WHAT YOU MUST DO
        ===========================================================

        STEP 1 — ACKNOWLEDGE. There is no customer-side self-help; the technical team must inspect the page to find the duplicate instance. Reply:
        "Issue về widget bị duplicate này cần team kỹ thuật kiểm tra trực tiếp trên store. Mình sẽ chuyển ticket sang team để các bạn xử lý. Trước đó, cho mình xin thêm vài thông tin nhé."

        STEP 2 — Collect:
        a) Editor link of the affected page. Ask: "Bạn gửi mình link editor của trang đang gặp lỗi nhé."
        b) Detailed description — WHICH app/widget + WHERE it appears duplicated. Ask: "Bạn cho mình biết widget hoặc app nào đang bị duplicate (ví dụ: review app, bundle app, third-party app …) và vị trí nó hiển thị đúng lẽ ra như thế nào nhé."
        c) Visual evidence (OPTIONAL but helpful): "Nếu được, bạn gửi mình ảnh chụp trang live đang hiện widget bị duplicate — bạn có thể paste link hoặc đính kèm file trực tiếp trong chat cũng được."
        d) Publish consent: "Khi team kỹ thuật fix xong, mình publish luôn trang lên cho bạn nhé? (cần publish để áp dụng fix)"

        STEP 3 — Have editor_link + description + user said YES to publish. BEFORE calling the tool, ask the customer to EXIT the editor and WAIT for explicit confirmation:
        Reply: "Vui lòng giúp chúng tôi thoát editor để Technical team truy cập và check giúp bạn, vì nếu bạn và chúng tôi trong 1 editor sẽ bị conflict và không thể lưu version mới nhất"

        STEP 4 — After the customer has explicitly confirmed they have exited the editor:
        a) Call escalate_duplicate_widget_issue with: issue_description (English, name the app), editor_link, user_consented_to_publish=true, user_exited_editor=true. If user pasted screenshot URLs include them in screenshot_urls. If user attached files in chat set customer_attached_files=true. ALWAYS include customer_last_message_text.
        b) Inspect the response:
           - If is_ready_for_escalation === false AND missing_info contains "customer_homepage_url" → relay next_step_for_user verbatim (asks the customer for their store homepage URL). After the customer sends their homepage URL, call again with customer_homepage_url=that URL.
           - If is_ready_for_escalation === false AND missing_info contains "store_access" → relay next_step_for_user verbatim. Wait for the customer to confirm access has been granted, then call again.
           - If is_ready_for_escalation === false AND missing_info contains "editor_exit" → relay next_step_for_user verbatim. Wait for the customer to confirm they've exited, then call again with user_exited_editor=true.
           - If note_posted === true → reply with next_step_for_user verbatim.
           - If note_posted === false → reply with next_step_for_user. If you can post a Crisp private note natively, post crisp_note.content. note_post_error explains why.

        ===========================================================
        OUTPUT HANDLING
        ===========================================================

        - is_ready_for_escalation === false → Do NOT post any note. Ask the user for what is listed in missing_info, using next_step_for_user as your reply.
        - is_ready_for_escalation === true AND note_posted === true → Tool already posted. Reply with next_step_for_user.
        - is_ready_for_escalation === true AND note_posted === false → Reply with next_step_for_user. If you can post a Crisp private note natively, post crisp_note.content unchanged.

        ===========================================================
        LANGUAGE OF YOUR REPLY TO THE USER
        ===========================================================

        next_step_for_user is already in the customer's language. Reply with it VERBATIM. The STEP scripts above are in Vietnamese as default; adapt to the customer's language naturally. crisp_note.content is always English — for the TS team.

        ===========================================================
        EXACT NOTE FORMAT (do not change)
        ===========================================================

        Issue: <issue_description>[, screenshot: <urls or "customer attached files in ticket">]
        Editor: <editor_link>
        Ticket: <ticket_url or "(unknown)" if omitted>
        Allowed to publish (user consented)
